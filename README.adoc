* *UltiStudent* is a student application that effectively tackles the problem of having too many applications to manage
  their school life. To improve the quality of student life in computing, UltiStudent provides a centralised platform
  for them to manage their homework, cumulative average point and notes.
* *UltiStudent* is a desktop application which has a GUI but **most** of the user interactions happen using a
CLI (Command Line Interface). It is an application intended for students who prefer CLI over GUI to manage their
school activities.
* What students can achieve using *UltiStudent* would be:
** Homework management
** Notes creation and management
** CAP tracking and calculation
