== Introduction

UltiStudent is a student application that effectively tackles the problem of having
too many applications to manage their school life by providing a centralised platform
for them to manage their homework, cumulative average point and notes.

UltiStudent is catered for students who prefer to use a desktop app for managing their
school activities through a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits
of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Therefore if you can type fast, why not give UltiStudent a try to speed up your
management of school activities!

[[Features]]
== Features

UltiStudent consists of 3 key features to help you manage your student life:
Homework Manager, Notes Manager, CAP Manager.

=== HomeworkManager
Let this handy manager can help you to manage your homework by adding, deleting, editing your homework
based on your progress. You can also check on the deadlines of all your homework before
deciding which homework to attempt!

=== NotesManager
In this manager, you can add, delete, edit and save your notes here. Every note saved
here counts toward saving the environment by not using paper! Lets fight against global
warming! Fighting!

=== CAPManager
This manager will help you to record and keep track of your Cumulative Aggregate Points (CAP)!
Simply add, deleting and editing the grades for modules you have taken to see immediately what your updated CAP score is!
Not only that, you can even use the CAPManager to project future CAP scores!

This manager will always be your reminder to work hard and get
more 'A's for future modules! At the same time allows you to have an overview of your
completed modules which provides you the assistance you need to plan for your upcoming
semesters.

[[Commands]]
== Commands
As UltiStudent contains many different commands and features, do refer to the command
format below to help you better understand how to use each command to their best.

*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in
`add-hw mc/MODULECODE hw/HOMEWORK d/dd/mm/yyyy`, `MODULECODE` is a parameter which
can be used as `add-hw mc/CS2103T` but of course you would have to do the same for
`HOMEWORK` and `dd/mm/yyyy`.

* All parameters must be supplied by users: `add-hw mc/MODULECODE hw/HOMEWORK d/DEADLINE`.


=== General Commands
The commands here are applicable in UltiStudent's 3 Managers +
HomeworkManager, NotesManager, CapManager.

The commands differ by the entity placed at the end of each command. `add-x`, `delete-x`,
`edit-x` where `x` should be replaced by either "hw" for homework, "note" for note,
or "cap" for cumulative average point!

==== Viewing help : `help`
Not sure how to get started? Not to worry! Simply type 'help' for more clarity!
Opens up the help window. +

Format: `help`

==== Listing entered commands : `history`
If you would like to review what you have done in your current session of UltiStudent, simply use our history command!
This command will help to retrieve the previously executed commands which has been entered into the system before `history`.



// tag::undoredo[]
==== Undoing previous command : `undo`

Restores the UltiStudent to the state before the previous _undoable_ command was executed. +
Format: `undo`

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify the UltiStudent's content in
the various manager e.g. for Homework Manager
(`add-hw`, `delete-hw`, `edit-hw`).
====

Examples:

* `delete-hw 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete-hw 1` command) +

* `delete-note 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete-note 1` command) +

* `delete-hw 1` +
`add mc/CS2101 hw/Tutorial 1 d/03/03/2019` +
`undo` (reverses the `add` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete-hw 1` command) +

==== Redoing the previously undone command : `redo`

Reverses the most recent `undo` command. +
Format: `redo`

Examples:

* `delete-hw 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete-hw 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete-hw 1` command) +

* `delete-note 1` +
`redo` +
The `redo` command fails as there are no `undo` commands executed previously.
// end::undoredo[]

==== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`

==== Saving the data

UltiStudent data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

=== Homework Manager
// tag::add-hw[]
==== Adding a homework: `add-hw`

Have a homework but unable to attend to it immediately? No worries! Let Homework Manager help
you keep track of them! By using `add-hw`, you can command this manager to remember your homework
for you!

Sadly, it doesn't do your homework for you... but hey it reduces your worries on forgetting
your homework!

To use this command you have to adhere to this format: `add-hw mc/MODULECODE hw/HOMEWORK d/DEADLINE`
else homework manager would not be able to understand what you are trying to tell it to do.

[IMPORTANT]
DEADLINE must be in dd/mm/yyyy format and DEADLINE should not be a date that is before today!

Okay enough explanation and time for an example!

Lets say we have to do Tutorial 1 for CS1101S by 1st May 2019. We could command this manager to
remember it for us by using `add-hw mc/CS1101S hw/Tutorial 1 d/01/05/2019`.


[TIP]
Pro tip here! The ordering of `mc/MODULECODE`, `hw/HOMEWORK` and `d/DEADLINE` can be jumbled around!
so do not worry that this handy manager will not understand what you are trying to command it to do!

[CAUTION]
Sadly Homework Manager is english educated only... Therefore it only accepts english characters and numbers.
Maybe Homework Manager would be educated in other languages to accept other characters in future!

// end::add-hw[]

image::CapManagerInterface.png[width="790"]


Now that you're all set, let's see how Cap Manager can help us!

==== Adding a CAP entry: `add-cap`
Adds a new CAP entry to the CAP Manager +

Let's assume it's the end of the semester and you just got your grades back.
Simply add your modules to the Cap Manager with the `add-cap` command to view your updated CAP!

Format: `add-cap mc/MODULECODE g/MODULEGRADE mcs/MODULECREDITS sem/MODULESEMESTER`

[width="80%",cols="1,2,2",options="header"]
|=========================================================
|Parameter |Input type |Example
|mc/MODULECODE |Module Code of the Module | mc/CS2103T
|g/MODULEGRADE |Module Grade received| g/A
|mcs/MODULECREDITS |Number of Modular Credits the module is worth| mcs/4
|sem/MODULESEMESTER |The Semester the module was taken in| sem/Y1S1

|=========================================================

Examples:

* `add-cap mc/CS2101 g/B+ mcs/4 sem/Y2S2`

Adds CS2101 into the CAP Manager, with a grade of B+ and 4 Modular Credits.

First open CAP Manager

image::OpenCapManager.png[width="790"]

Then use the `add-cap` command.

//image of added cap

And just like that your CAP Manager will now include the module you just added.
The semester list will also be updated if you are adding a module that is newly taken.
Not only that, your CAP score will be updated right away!


==== Editing a CAP Entry by index: `edit-cap`
If you made a mistake in entering the information for any particular CAP entry, do not worry!
 `edit-cap` command can easily fix that.

Edits an existing cap entry in the UltiStudent by the use of index. +
Format: `edit-cap INDEX  [mc/MODULECODE] [g/MODULEGRADE] [mcs/MODULECREDITS] [sem/MODULESEMESTER]`
****
* Edits the CAP entry at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed CAP Entries list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.

****

Examples:

* `edit-cap 1 g/A` +
 Edits the module grade of the 1st cap entry in cap manager to be `A`
* `edit-cap 3 mc/CS2102 g/B+` +
Edits the module code of the 3rd cap entry and the grade obtained to `B+`.

==== Editing a CAP Entry by module code: `edit-cap-mc`
UltiStudent understands that students have to take many modules in their University life, as such,

As such the `edit-cap-mc` allows users to edit the parameters of a __ by the using the module code instead of the index
for more convenience!

Format: `edit-cap-mc MODULECODE [mc/MODULECODE] [g/MODULEGRADE] [mcs/MODULECREDITS] [sem/MODULESEMESTER]`
****
* Edits the CAP entry with the specified MODULECODE. The module code *must* be valid.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.

****

Examples:

* `edit-cap-mc CS2100 g/B-` +
 Edits the module grade of CS2100 in cap manager to be `B-`
* `edit-cap CS2103T mc/CS2102 g/A+` +
Edits the cap entry of CS2103T to become that of a cap entry for CS2102 and sets the grade obtained to `B+`.

==== Deleting a CAP entry: `delete-cap`

If you ever do need to delete a CAP entry in the CAP Manager, you may use this command to easily delete that specific CAP Entry.
After executing the command
Deletes the specified CAP entry from the CAP Manager. +
Format: `delete-cap INDEX`

****
* Deletes the CAP entry at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed CAP Entries list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...

****

Examples:

==== Filtering a CAP entry: `find-sem`

If you would like to view the modules you have taken for particular semester(s), then find-sem will be handy!

Format: `find-sem SEMESTER ...`

//warning: do note that cap score does not update such that it only calculates the CAP score for the modules displayed
// using the find-sem method. The cap score is stil that for all the modules in the cap entry.
// if you wish to exist, refer to list command

==== Filtering a CAP entry: `list-cap`

This command displays all the modules inside the CAP manager.
This command is most helpful after the use of `find-sem` command.

Format: `list-cap`
