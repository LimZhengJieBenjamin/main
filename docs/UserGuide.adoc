== Introduction

HomeworkManager-Level1 is for students who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their school activities*. More importantly, it is *optimized for students who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, it can not only help you to manage your homework but also serve as a timetable, CAP calculator and Notes keeping! Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
