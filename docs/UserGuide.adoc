== Introduction

UltiStudent is a student application that effectively tackles the problem of having
too many applications to manage their school life by providing a centralised platform
for them to manage their homework, cumulative average point and notes.

UltiStudent is catered for students who prefer to use a desktop app for managing their
school activities through a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits
of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Therefore if you can type fast, why not give UltiStudent a try to speed up your
management of school activities!

Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

[[Features]]
== Features

UltiStudent consists of 3 key features to help you manage your student life:
Homework Manager, Notes Manager, CAP Manager.

=== HomeworkManager
Let this handy manage manage your homework by adding, deleting, editing your homework
based on your progress. You can also check on the deadlines of all your homework before
deciding which homework to attempt!

=== NotesManager
In this manager, you can add, delete, edit and save your notes here. Every note saved
here counts toward saving the environment by not using paper! Lets fight against global
warming! Fighting!

=== CAPManager
This manager allows you to record and keep track of your Cumulative Aggregate Points (CAP)
by adding, deleting the grades you have received for modules you have taken and also
project your current CAP.

This manager will always be your reminder to work hard and get
more 'A's for future modules! At the same time allows you to have an overview of your
completed modules which provides you the assistance you need to plan for your upcoming
semesters.

[[Commands]]
== Commands
As UltiStudent contains many different commands and features, do refer to the command
format below to help you better understand how to use each command to their best.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in
`add-hw mc/MODULECODE hw/HOMEWORK d/dd/mm/yyyy`, `MODULECODE` is a parameter which
can be used as `add-hw mc/CS2103T` but of course you would have to do the same for
`HOMEWORK` and `dd/mm/yyyy`.

* All parameters must be supplied by users: `add-hw mc/MODULECODE hw/HOMEWORK d/DEADLINE`.

[IMPORTANT]
=====
DEADLINE must be in dd/mm/yyyy
=====

====

=== General Commands
The commands here are applicable in UltiStudent's 3 Managers: HomeworkManager, NotesManager, CapManager.

The commands differ by the entity placed at the end of each command. `add-x`, `delete-x`,
`edit-x` where `x` should be replaced by either "hw" for homework, "note" for note,
or "cap" for cumulative average point!

==== Opening a manager : `open`
This command will usually be your first and frequently used command in UltiStudent! But fret not, I will teach
you on how to use this powerful command that is applicable to all Managers in UltiStudent.

To use this command, we have to adhere to this format: `open MANAGER` else UltiStudent would not be able to
understand what we are trying to tell it to do.

Example time!

Lets say we have a Homework to add, edit or delete, we can easily use `open HomeworkManager` to command UltiStudent
to open Homework Manager for us! Same goes for Notes Manager `open NotesManager` and Cap Manager `open CapManager`.

With this, we can begin our journey with UltiStudent to become an ultimate student!

==== Viewing help : `help`
Opens up the help window. +
Format: `help`

==== Listing entered commands : `history`

Retrieves the last 3 commands which has been entered into the system before `history`.


// tag::undoredo[]
==== Undoing previous command : `undo`

Restores the UltiStudent to the state before the previous _undoable_ command was executed. +
Format: `undo`

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify the UltiStudent's content in
the various manager e.g. for Homework Manager
(`add-hw`, `delete-hw`, `edit-hw`).
====

Examples:

* `delete-hw 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete-hw 1` command) +

* `delete-note 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete-note 1` command) +

* `delete-hw 1` +
`add mc/CS2101 hw/Tutorial 1 d/03/03/2019` +
`undo` (reverses the `add` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete-hw 1` command) +

==== Redoing the previously undone command : `redo`

Reverses the most recent `undo` command. +
Format: `redo`

Examples:

* `delete-hw 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete-hw 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete-hw 1` command) +

* `delete-note 1` +
`redo` +
The `redo` command fails as there are no `undo` commands executed previously.
// end::undoredo[]

==== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`

==== Saving the data

UltiStudent data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

=== Homework Manager
// tag::add-hw[]
==== Adding a homework: `add-hw`

Have a homework but unable to attend to it immediately? No worries! Let Homework Manager help
us keep track of them! By using `add-hw`, we can command this manager to remember our homework
for us! Make sure we are in the Homework Manager by using `open HomeworkManager` first!

Sadly, it doesn't do our homework for us... but hey it reduces our worries on forgetting our homework!

To use this command we have to adhere to this format: `add-hw mc/MODULECODE hw/HOMEWORK d/DEADLINE`
else Homework Manager would not be able to understand what we are trying to tell it to do.

[IMPORTANT]
DEADLINE must be in dd/mm/yyyy format and DEADLINE should not be a date that is before today!

Okay enough explanation and time for an example!

Lets say we have to do Tutorial 1 for CS1101S by 1st May 2019. We could command this manager to
remember it for us by using `add-hw mc/CS1101S hw/Tutorial 1 d/01/05/2019` in the red highlighted box and
do make sure that you are in the homework manager which is indicated by the highlighted icon in the white
highlighted box as shown below.

image::Add-Hw UG.png[width="790"]

When CS1101S tutorial 1 has been successfully added, the green highlighted box would indicate the success.
We will also be able to view the CS1101S being added into the blue highlighted box since this is the first
homework for CS1101S we have and the orange highlighted box would show us what homework we have.

[TIP]
Pro tip here! The ordering of `mc/MODULECODE`, `hw/HOMEWORK` and `d/DEADLINE` can be jumbled around!
so do not worry that this handy manager will not understand what you are trying to command it to do!

[CAUTION]
Sadly Homework Manager is english educated only... Therefore it only accepts english characters and numbers.
Maybe Homework Manager would be educated in other languages to accept other characters in future!

// end::add-hw[]

==== Editing a homework: `edit-hw`

Edits an existing homework entry in the UltiStudent +
Format: `edit-homework INDEX  [mc/MODULECODE] [hw/HOMEWORK]
[d/DEADLINE]`
****

==== Deleting a homework: `delete-hw`

Deletes the specified homework from the UltiStudent. +
Format: `delete-hw INDEX`

****
* Deletes the homework at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed homework list.

// tag::edit-note[]
==== Editing and Saving a note : `edit-note` `save-note`

===== Editing note: `edit-note`
Hurray! We've successfully added a note therefore it is time for us to learn how to edit and save the edited notes!
But first! we got to make sure we are in the Notes Manager by looking at the Notes icon in the white highlighted
box as shown below.

image::Edit&Save-Note UG.png[width="790"]

Now that we are in the Notes Manager. It is time for us to start editing our note! First off, we have to use
`edit-note INDEX` to select the notes that we want to edit.

For example, we have 2 notes currently as shown in the image above, and we would like to edit our Personal
Project Portfolio note. We will use `edit-note 1` in the red highlighted box to open *Personal Project
Portfolio* note for editing.

When Notes Manager has successfully open our note, it will indicate in the green highlighted box. At the same
time, the note will be highlighted in blue in the blue highlighted box and the text field in the orange
highlighted box will turn white and allow us to start jotting down our notes!

===== Saving note: `save-note`

Now that we are done editing our note, it is time to save them! We can do this easily by using the `save-note` in
the red highlighted box!

Once the note is saved, Notes Manager will let us know by indicating what we have saved
in the green highlighted box. At the same time, the textfield in the orange highlighted box will be disabled. For
`save-note` there is no parameters as it will save all edited notes in notes manager.

[TIP]
Pro tip here! We can edit multiple notes at the same time by using edit-note 1 then edit-note 2 to open the
respective notes to edit. Once we are done editing, we can simply use `save-note` to save all the edited notes!

// end::edit-note[]
