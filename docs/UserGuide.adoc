== Introduction

UltiStudent is for students who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their school activities*. More importantly, it is *optimized for students who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, it can not only help you to manage your homework but also serve as a timetable, CAP calculator and Notes keeping! Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `HomeworkManager.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your UltiStudent.
