== Overview

This portfolio documents my contributions towards the UltiStudent project
which is part of an introductory software engineering module known as **CS2103T - Software Engineering**.
During this module, we have been provided with a working software application
and could enhance and morph our application to suit our target audience.

The purpose of this document is present the principles and practical skills
I have learnt throughout the course of this module.

== PROJECT: UltiStudent

*UltiStudent* is a student application that effectively tackles the problem of having too many applications to manage
their school life. Having a large number of different platforms can lead to inconvenience, incompatibilities
and inorganisation. *UltiStudent* tackles this problem by providing a centralised platform
for them to manage their homework, cumulative average point and notes to improve the quality of their school life.

*UltiStudent* provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) for students to interact with and is complemented by a
Graphical User Interface (GUI). We have designed the application with user-friendliness in mind.

== Summary of contributions

|===
|This section contains the key contributions I have made towards this project. They highlight my ability to +
1) model and design the application to cater to our target users. +
2) create a working software application that is user-friendly and error-free. +
3) design and create test cases which ensured that the HomeworkManager is error free.

* *Major Enhancement*:
** Developed the `Model`, `Logic` and `Storage` infrastructure for the Homework Manager.
*** *Functionality*: Allows the user to `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `find` and `list` in the homework entries. Provides the
foundations on which these features are built.
*** *Justification:* The ability to create homework entries and other features such as edit depends on the Homework Manager
                   infrastructure. This enhances the features of the UltiStudent by allowing students
                   to manage their homework on our application.
*** *Highlights:* This enhancement is a core component of our application. It affects the current functionalities of our
application and the future extensions of our application. To do this well requires an in-depth understanding of the
initial infrastructure of the software in order to alter it. The implementation was also difficult because various abstraction
layers had to be understood.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** *Edit Homework command* that edits the attributes of current existing homework entries based on user input
** *Delete Homework command* that deletes the attributes  whose note name has the keywords
indicated by the user.
** *Find Module command* that filters all the homework entries based on a list of modules.
** *List Homework command* that shows the entire list of homework entries in the Homework Manager.
